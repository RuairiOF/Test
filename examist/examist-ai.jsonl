It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two main stages:\n1. Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes and use sunlight to split water molecules, releasing oxygen and transferring energy to ATP and NADPH.\n2. Calvin cycle: This takes place in the stroma, using ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of enzyme-driven steps.\nOverall, photosynthesis can be summarized by the equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2."}]}
